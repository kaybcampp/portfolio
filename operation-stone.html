            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>The client, a small business owner, needed a seamless migration from an old CRM to a new one without losing real-time transaction data. They required both CRMs to remain linked, ensuring live data transfer for ongoing transactions and organized storage for easy access.</p>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Using API integration, I developed a Python script to automate live data synchronization between the CRMs. This script runs at set intervals, maintaining accuracy and up-to-date information. The data is organized and stored in a separate file for efficient access, providing the client with a centralized view of all transactions.</p>
            
            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>This project was completed for the client and continues to operate as needed to date!</p>
